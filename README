Net-eBay

  This module allows users to communicate with eBay using perl and their
  XML based eBay API. You can use it to list items for sale, bid, get
  seller item list, search, get ebay time, or do anything else.
  
  Many details of this API can be found at http://developer.ebay.com. To
  be able to use this module, you need to register there and obtain keys
  and a authentication token using "tokentool".
  
  The job of its module is to encapsulate connectivity and
  authentication, and communication with ebay. First, you need to
  initialize your ebay connection by passing it credentials. After that,
  you can send queries to eBay. A typical request is comprised of its
  name, and a hash table of application parameters.
  
  Example of listing an item for sale:
  
  use Net::eBay;
  use Data::Dumper;
  
  my $ebay = new Net::eBay( {
                                site_level => 'prod',
                                DeveloperKey => '...',
                                ApplicationKey => '...',
                                CertificateKey => '...',
                                Token => '...',
                               } ); 
  
  my $result = $ebay->submitRequest( "AddItem",
                        {
                         DetailLevel => "0",
                         ErrorLevel => "1",
                         SiteId = > "0",
                         Verb => "  AddItem",
                         Category => "14111",
                         CheckoutDetailsSpecified => "0",
                         Country => "us",
                         Currency => "1",
                         Description => "For sale is like new <A HREF=http://www.example.com/jhds/>thingamabob</A>.Shipping is responsibility of the buyer.",
                         Duration => "7",
                         Location => "Anytown, USA, 43215",
                         Gallery => 1,
                         GalleryURL => 'http://igor.chudov.com/images/mark_mattson.jpg',
                         MinimumBid => "0.99",
                         BuyItNowPrice => 19.99,
                         PayPalAccepted => "1",
                         PayPalEmailAddress => "ichudov\@example.com",
                         Quantity => "1",
                         Region => "60",
                         Title => "Igor's Item with Gallery xaxa",
                        }
                      );
  
    print "Result: " . Dumper( $result ) . "\n";
  
  Result of submitRequest is a perl hash obtained from the response XML using XML::Simple, something like this:
  
  Result: $VAR1 = {
            'Item' => {
                      'Id' => '4503546598',
